      <h2>5. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
      <h3>Billing</h3>

      <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
      <p>Our Apps are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied,

        device failure, app deletion, or any other cause. We recommend using iOS device backups to protect your data.</p>
      <p>Our total liability to you for any claims arising from or related to these Terms or your use of our Apps shall
        not exceed the amount you have paid to us in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim.</p>

      <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of material changes by updating the
        "Last updated" date at the top of this page. Your continued use of our Apps after changes are posted constitutes

        use the Apps will immediately cease.</p>

      <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Victoria, Australia,
        without regard to its conflict of law provisions. Any disputes arising under these Terms shall be subject to the
        exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Victoria, Australia.</p>

      <h2>12. Severability</h2>
      <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or
