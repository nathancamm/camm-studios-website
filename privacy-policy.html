    </div>

    <div class="legal-content">

      <p>Camm Studios ("we", "our", or "us") operates mobile applications (the "Apps"). This Privacy Policy explains how
        we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our Apps.</p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
      <p>Our Apps store your content (such as journal entries, affirmations, vision board images, and preferences)
        <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not transmit this content to our servers.</p>
      <p>During onboarding, some of our Apps may ask you for profile information such as your first name, age range,
        gender, and personal interests. This information is used to personalise your experience and may be shared with
        our third-party analytics and paywall services (see Section 4 below).</p>

      <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
      <p>We collect usage data to improve our Apps through third-party analytics services:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Device model, operating system version, and app version</li>
        <li><strong>Usage analytics:</strong> Feature usage events (e.g. screens viewed, actions taken), collected via
          <strong>PostHog</strong></li>
        <li><strong>App lifecycle events:</strong> App launches, sessions, and background transitions</li>
        <li><strong>Crash reports:</strong> Anonymous crash data to help us fix bugs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This data is associated with anonymous identifiers and does not include your name, email, or locally stored
        content.</p>

      <h3>Subscription Information</h3>
      <p>All subscription purchases and billing are processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect or store
        your payment information. Subscription status is managed through <strong>Superwall</strong>, which receives an
        anonymous user identifier and purchase receipts to verify your subscription.</p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide and maintain our Apps</li>
        <li>To personalise your experience (e.g. tailored paywall offers)</li>
        <li>To improve app performance and fix bugs through analytics</li>
        <li>To verify subscription status</li>
        <li>To understand how features are used so we can improve them</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>Your personal content (journal entries, affirmations, vision board items, etc.) is stored <strong>only on your
          device</strong> and is not backed up to our servers. If you delete the App, your locally stored data will be
        permanently deleted.</p>
      <p>Profile attributes collected during onboarding and usage analytics are transmitted to our third-party service
        providers (see Section 4). We rely on these providers' security practices to protect this data.</p>

      <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Our Apps use the following third-party services that may receive data:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>PostHog</strong> (analytics) — Receives anonymous usage events, device information, and user
          attributes. Data is processed on servers in the United States. <a
            href="https://posthog.com/privacy" style="color: var(--text-dark); text-decoration: underline;"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">PostHog Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><strong>Superwall</strong> (paywall and subscription management) — Receives anonymous user identifiers,
          user profile attributes, and subscription status for paywall personalisation. <a
            href="https://superwall.com/privacy" style="color: var(--text-dark); text-decoration: underline;"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superwall Privacy Policy</a></li>
        <li><strong>Apple App Store</strong> — Processes all subscription purchases and billing</li>
        <li><strong>Vercel</strong> — Hosts our website and collects anonymous web analytics</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not sell your personal information to any third party.</p>

      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
      <p>Locally stored data persists on your device until you delete the App. Analytics data held by third-party
        providers is retained according to their respective data retention policies. We do not maintain our own servers
        or databases containing your personal data.</p>

      <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Our Apps are not intended for anyone under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
        children. If you are under 18, please do not use our Apps. If we learn that we have collected information from a
        person under 18, we will take steps to delete that information.</p>

      <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>

      <h3>All Users</h3>
      <p>Since your content is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it at all times. You can delete
        all locally stored data by deleting the App.</p>

        <li>Data portability</li>
        <li>Withdraw consent at any time</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by updating the
